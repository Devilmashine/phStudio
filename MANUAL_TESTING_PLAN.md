# Manual Testing Plan for Photo Studio CRM

## üéØ Objective
To manually test the Photo Studio CRM system to ensure all components are working correctly after development completion.

## üìã Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL client
- Git

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup

#### Create Environment Files
```bash
# Copy development environment template
cp .env.development.template .env

# Edit .env file with actual values
# Make sure to update:
# - SECRET_KEY with a secure random key
# - TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID if using Telegram integration
```

#### Install Backend Dependencies
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Install performance testing dependencies (optional)
pip3 install -r requirements-performance.txt
```

#### Install Frontend Dependencies
```bash
# From project root
npm install
```

### 2. Database Setup

#### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)
```bash
# Start database services
docker-compose up -d db redis

# Wait for services to be ready
docker-compose ps

# Initialize database
docker-compose exec db psql -U postgres -d photo_studio -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;"
```

#### Manual Database Setup (Alternative)
```bash
# If you have PostgreSQL installed locally
createdb photo_studio
psql -d photo_studio -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;"
```

### 3. Database Migration
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Run migrations
alembic upgrade head
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

### Option 1: Using Docker Compose (Recommended for testing)
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Check service status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Option 2: Manual Start

#### Start Backend
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Start the FastAPI server
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8888 --reload
```

#### Start Frontend
```bash
# From project root
npm run dev
```
